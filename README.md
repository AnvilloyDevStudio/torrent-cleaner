# Torrent Cleaner
Torrent Cleaner is a small and light utility written in Rust for directory torrenting cleaning. This is useful especially if there are updates available for particularly some torrents.

## Motivation

This project is inspired by and based on a [Java utility](https://torrent-directory-comparison.sourceforge.io/) in [qBittorrent #3842](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/issues/3842).
The corresponding source code for that utility is also availble [on GitHub](https://github.com/nickreserved/Torrent-Directory-Comparison).
